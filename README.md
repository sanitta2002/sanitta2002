### 🎯 My Developer Journey
> "I started coding in high school with C, which introduced me to the world of programming and sparked my interest in development. During my BCA studies, I gained a good understanding of web development, but I felt my knowledge wasn’t deep enough to build real-world applications. That’s when I decided to focus on mastering one core language—JavaScript. The more I explored it, the more I realized its versatility and potential in modern web development. This curiosity led me to dive into the MERN stack, where I could develop both frontend and backend applications, This decision has shaped my journey into full-stack development, allowing me to build real-world applications and continuously expand my skills"
